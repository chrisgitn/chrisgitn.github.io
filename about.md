## About this Website
This is a website where I can show off my coding projects

## WikiRaces
Update 1: I've made a local website that I can change the style of, currently trying to figure out how to work the Wikipedia API. It is a little confusing on how to use the API.

Update 2: The game portion is pretty much complete along with a timer. The only thing I need to add functionality
wise is for the website to reset after every refresh. After that, I would like to make the website look nicer with images and formatting
