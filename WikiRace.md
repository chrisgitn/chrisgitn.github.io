## [WikiRace](https://chrisgitn.github.io/WikiRace)
Update 1: I've made a local website that I can change the style of, currently trying to figure out how to work the Wikipedia API. It is a little confusing on how to use the API.

Update 2: The game portion is pretty much complete along with a timer. The only thing I need to add functionality
wise is for the website to reset after every refresh. After that, I would like to make the website look nicer with images and formatting

Update 3: The links now reset when the page is refreshed, I made a few minor visual changes to the website, and added milliseconds to the timer. Unfortunately the timer only works when the tab is focused, meaning you have to open the Wiki page in another window in order for the timer to run in the background. I tried a few work arounds like the Web Workers API, but I could never get it to work even outside of this project. I might visit this project later on to fix this issue, but the website and the game on it still function properly.
